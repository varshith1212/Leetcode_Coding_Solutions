"""PROBLEM - 9"""
"""Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not."""
 
"""
Example 1:
	Input: x = 121
	Output: true
Example 2:
	Input: x = -121
	Output: false
	Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
